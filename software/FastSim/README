FastSim can be useful for generating background (or even toy data sets
for acceptance studies).

* It uses TGenPhaseSpace to generate b events.
* FONLL is used to boost the b.
* The daughter particle momenta are smeared correctly.
* Cuts can be made on daughter particle properties.
* There are tools to swap mass hypothesis.

To start look at PhaseHaofei.C . This generates Bs->phipipi and applies Haofeis cuts.

To run in ROOT do the following:

  .L RooRelBreitWigner.C+
  .L functions.h+
  .L PhaseHaofei.C+

   PhaseHaofei()

TODO

Switch to using CMake in order to compile code properly.
