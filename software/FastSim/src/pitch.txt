The interactions of all known fundamental particles are described by the Standard Model. Over the last forty years its predictions have been confirmed by experiment with high precision. However, there are several reasons to suspect the Standard Model is incomplete. For example it does not explain dark matter, why there are three generations of fundamental particles or the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Many theories of new physics beyond the Standard Model have been proposed to explain these problems - for example supersymmetry or large extra dimensions. One way experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are probing for new physics effects is to by studying rare decays involving b-quarks. In these process new particles may be produced virtually by quantum loop effects. If new physics is present the rate of such processes can be enhanced and new sources of CP violation could be present - as needed to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem. One such process is the rare decay of the Bs  meson to two muons.

Recently, the LHCb and CMS collaborations have jointly reported the observation of this decay, the cumulation of over 20 years of searches at the LHC and elsewhere. This project explores their results. How was the measurement made ? What are the results ? Do they agree with the Standard Model and how to they impact on ideas about new physics ? How will the measurements be improved in the next LHC run period ?
